Weakness: Can only represent 1 week up to 512 tasks at a time. <br />
Opportunity: Could become a competitive app on the market and popularize these features in task managers <br />
Threat: People could try to spam too many tasks and crash the app. To resolve, we set a limit on the number of tasks to 512. <br />
