# Retro Active meeting

Not much to discuss as the next week's work has yet to be released. However we took the opportunity to discuss the good and bad from the warmup project, and how to proceed with the main project.

## Previous week 

### Nikhil and Charlotte 

- Brainstormed various designs including color coding and structure of the widget, came up with various methods of implementation for the task list widget, and helped distribute work amongst everyone.

### Newton, Kevin, Brian, and Zhamilya

- Worked on implementing the task list widget with basic features such as adding categories and adding tasks in each category. Created the JSON file, made the design of the widget using CSS, and developed the majority of the Task List.

## Feedback for the main project / following weeks

- Oragnize the slack channel better for more efficient communcication
- Make team meetings mandatory for everyone to improve team participation and ensure everyone is contributing to the project.
- We also decided to group up team members in groups of 2 or 3 to work on different aspects of the project to balance the workload and improve efficiency.
